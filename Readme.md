# Ankidown

Ankidown is an in-progress add-on for Anki, the spaced repetition system.
It's primary purpose is to prevent duplicate effort and streamline the creation of Anki cards from your pre-existing non-anki notes.

Currently Ankidown allows you to import a file and it's template, and convert it directly into a pre-existing Note Type (read the Anki manual if this is unfamiliar).

## Contributing

Everyone is welcome to open issues and to suggest new features. Slight word of warning is that Ankidown is still in the rapid prototyping (read: chaotic) phase, so pull requests might not be the best idea till it's a little more stable.
